Senior Design Contract
Project Summary
We are proposing to create a site to allow students to order and pick up or deliver convenience
items from a location on campus. To avoid the unnecessary and potentially dangerous troubles
of the surrounding area and to be assured that they can receive or pick up their order at any
time that is convenient to them.
Problem Statement
Students at the University of Cincinnati lead busy lives, juggling classwork and extracurricular
activities, leaving them with little time for shopping. When they do find time, it often isn't at
the most convenient hours. They may not have the chance to shop during the day, and when
they do, it’s often too late, as the surrounding campus environment may not be very safe for
walking. One potential solution is to use DoorDash, but this presents its own set of issues.
During late hours, there are fewer Dashers available, which can delay the delivery of the order
or result in it not being picked up at all. Additionally, there is a safety concern, as students do
not know the person delivering their order.
Solution
Our solution is to create a site that allows students to easily place orders for pick up or delivery
of convenience items. Our number one concern is the safety and accessibility of our service. We
plan to keep our service running 24/7 and we plan to fully employ our workers to not run into
the same issues as our competitors. Are goal is to make sure that we have the order ready to
pick up or delivery in 20 minutes or less.

Project Source
The idea for our project came from the change in store hours after covid-19. There aren’t any
grocery stores open during the night. Some students have busy lives and by the time they come
home it is too late to go shopping and during the night it is scary to walk up to a grocery store
with active crime happening around the campus.
Project Objectives/Goals
Project Objectives:
Create a Comprehensive Update Library:
Develop a software application that allows the user to shop online for groceries and other
necessities, afterwards having the order delivered to the person or having a physical pickup
location inside the campus.
Enable User-Friendly Access:
Design a user-friendly interface that allows users to shop and track their orders with a simple
interface that is accessible by internet.
Establish Legal and Licensing Compliance:
Secure all necessary permissions and licensing agreements with University of Cincinnati and
local fulfillment center to ensure the safety and security of this application.
Promote User Choice and Control:
Empower users to choose the items they need or want whenever they want with a simple
application
Maintain a Secure Platform:
Implement security measures to protect the items library from unauthorized access, ensuring
that users have correct access and secure way to pay for their orders .
Support User Community:
Establish a user community where individuals can share their experiences, provide feedback,
and help troubleshoot issues related to updates.
User Education and Resources:
Provide educational materials and resources to guide users in the safe and effective use of the
application and payment processing operations.
Project Goals:
Increase convenience for students:
Make it easier for students to order and receive convenience items by providing a reliable and
user-friendly platform for pickup or delivery, saving them time and effort.
Increase User Satisfaction:
Improve the user experience when ordering items online and ensuring that they can get the
items they need whenever by tracking inventory and updating the website regularly
Improve User Experience:
Help Students around the UC campus get access to things they need with UI that is simple to use
and offers payments with their bearcat card.
Improve Campus safety:
Reduce the need for students to leave campus late at night by providing a safe and secure
delivery service, helping to improve personal safety.
Build a Supportive Community:
Foster a community of users who can collaborate, share experiences, and support one another
in dealing with order placement and tracking.
Legal and Ethical Compliance:
Ensure that the project operates within the boundaries of legal and ethical standards,
maintaining proper permissions and respect for intellectual property rights.
Enhance Security:
Ensure the security of the platform by protecting user data and preventing unauthorized access.
This includes implementing secure payment methods, encrypted data transmission, and
safeguarding the personal information of students, thereby minimizing the risk of data breaches
or malicious activity.
Educate and Empower Users:
Provide users with the knowledge and resources necessary to make informed decisions about
their device's software updates.
Team Members and Responsibilities
Osama Bondgji – Project Manager, Oversees the project, manages the team, and ensures that
the project meets its objectives and stays on schedule.
Samba Koita – Software Developer, My Role will be to focus on some of the backend of our
code.
Ali Alsheddi – Security Analyst, analyze potential risks, Ensure the privacy of users by
implementing data protection measures for any user data that might be handled by the
software.

Project Scope
The project's scope centers around the development of a computer-based software application
designed to give access to students around the campus to online grocery shopping anytime they
want and have it ready for pick-up or delivered at their convenience. The software would allow
the students to order items from the preselected categories and have it ready within certain
amount of time. The pickup location will be on campus, and the delivery will be offered to
students in the dormitories. Project is aimed towards giving students access to groceries in a
secure environment at any hour of the day. The application will be accessible by the people in
the campus (students, teachers, and etc.).

Technologies Used
We are still looking at which programming language we will use but it will be html and Node JS.
Thus, we will be using Visual Studio Code. We will also use SQL for our database. Our Project will
be hosted on Github.
Ethical Considerations
Ethical Dilemmas:
User Privacy and Data Security:
In developing a site that handles student orders and personal information (such as names,
addresses, and payment details), there is a risk of exposing sensitive data if the site is not
adequately secured. Unauthorized access or data breaches could compromise student safety
and privacy.
Ethical decision-making tools: Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA), Data Protection Impact
Assessment (DPIA), encryption protocols, and secure authentication mechanisms.
Integrity of Software:
The reliability and robustness of the site are critical to ensuring that orders are processed and
delivered as intended. Software bugs, glitches, or downtime could lead to issues like incorrect
orders, delays, or lost deliveries. Additionally, if the site is compromised or functions improperly,
it could cause frustration for users or, in the worst-case scenario, harm to their safety by giving
incorrect information, such as inaccurate delivery times or locations.
Ethical decision-making tools: Continuous software testing, Quality Assurance (QA) processes,
and regular security audits to ensure the system operates efficiently and securely.
End-User Capability:
Users with limited technical expertise may struggle with navigating the platform, potentially
leading to errors such as incorrect orders or misunderstanding delivery options.
Ethical decision-making tools: Informed consent, ensuring users understand the
risks.(Nissenbaum, 2010)
